=Metroid 2 - The Return of Samus
An extensive Metroid-themed graphics romhack for Zelda 2
So far it changes the player sprites, tiles, palettes, and some flavor text

For now it is slightly harder in some respects. As it is right now it also invalidates DDM, I may make a version that doesn't in the future
Other possible plans include:
* changing sprites
* make the world more metroid-themed
* changing music???
* gameplay romhack derived from this
