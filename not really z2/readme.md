extensive graphics romhack that replaces most graphics with ones from pokemon (and some custom ones)  
  
# instructions for randomizer
apply the base patch BEFORE randomizing, and use the result as the base file  
apply the color fixer to the generated rom  
  
this has not been tested enough, so it may still glitch up
  
  
credits to whoever in pzc's exgb tileset did the GB-style devamps for Dodongos, Manhandla, and Ganon  
the rest were taken from pokemon rgby/gsc, the gameboy zelda games, or drawn by myself 
  
known issues: digdogger looks weird, ganon only has two poses, red ring maybe shouldn't be orange, title screen and items may look weird, flute dungeons mess up the overworld palette for a moment
