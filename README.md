# z2-stuff  
mostly character hacks to be usable both for rando and playing the game  
the changes are tile and palette data only, to make it the most compatible  
(some of the sprites were added to the randomizer later on, though missing extra features)  
  
Link (FDS) - W A I T  
Stalfos - the no-rando version changes two small things but otherwise is the same  
Iron Knuckle - Probably the worst sprite  
Vase Girl - Could't decice between green and purple  
Error - You know Bagu?  
Dark Link - Some enemy proyectiles don't flash in dark caves, might fix if people really want  
Lucia - From Wing of Madoola  
Samus - From Metroid  
Simon - From Castlevania  
  
Some sprites (Samus, Lucia) use an unique palette at 140bf for the ending. (Although it is shared by the very first room of GP but it's something incredibly minor)  
  
there is a minor graphical glitch in some cases where dungeon containers get graphics overwritten by the now usused tiles in rando  
  
Don't play pyramid

## metroid houses

replaces the palaces graphics with ones from metroid. See "Metroid 2 Return of Samus" for a full graphics hack
