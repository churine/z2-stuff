# z2-stuff
# mostly character hacks to be usable both for rando and playing the game
the changes are tile and palette data only, to make it the most compatible

Link (FDS) - W A I T
Stalfos - the no-rando version changes two small things but otherwise is the same
Iron Knuckle - Probably the worst sprite
Vase Girl - Could't decice between green and purple
Error - You know Bagu?
Dark Link - Some enemy proyectiles don't flash in dark caves, might fix if people really want
Lucia - From Wing of Madoola
Samus - From Metroid
Simon - From Castlevania

Some sprites (Samus, Lucia) use an unique palette at 140bf for the ending. (Although it is shared by the very first room of GP but it's something incredibly minor)

Don't play pyramid
